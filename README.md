## TUTORIAL FOR CREATE CUSTOM MAP 

So , it's a "tutorial' only for information , i'm not expert and you can get problems when you do that ,
Before start all : at all readers, i will not be held responsible for any damages that could arise from using this website or softwares and acting upon the information that it contains.

For Question go on "Open issue" on github :) .

### What do i need for start? 

At first , you need use LeagueSandBox or other Emulator of L0L , in this exemple i will use LeagueSandBox Version december 2021 
(The tutorial can be doesn't work with other version, LeagueSandBox is frecently updated , i will try to update this page in the same time )

```markdown
I put the last version of LeagueSandBox , search in commit if you want old version :) 
# [Gameserver ( LeagueSandBox ) ](https://https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer)
# [L3ague 0f L3gend 4.20 Version Scrubbed ( Moddable ) ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVUGe75nMluczrY14xb0KDXiihFRlGnV/edit)
this one is necessary because we can ( for moment) only custom WGEO file , and 4.20 have the new summoners rift with WGEO files :)
