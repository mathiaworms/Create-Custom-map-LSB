## TUTORIAL FOR CREATE CUSTOM MAP 

So , it's a "tutorial' only for information , i'm not expert and you can get problems when you do that ,
Before start all : at all readers, i will not be held responsible for any damages that could arise from using this website or softwares and acting upon the information that it contains.

For Question go on "Open issue" on github :) .

## THANKS SO MUCH 

At first , i want say thanks for all help me , cabeca143 , Lizardy , Ishawdow0 , crauzer , Chewy , S0cr4te , Pupix And other 
I can't enumerate all but THANKS .

## What do i need for start? 

At first , you need use LeagueSandBox or other Emulator of L0L , in this exemple i will use LeagueSandBox Version december 2021 
(The tutorial can be doesn't work with other version, LeagueSandBox is frecently updated , i will try to update this page in the same time )


I put the last version of LeagueSandBox , search in commit if you want old version :) 
# [Gameserver ( LeagueSandBox ) ](https://https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer)
# [L3ague 0f L3gend 4.20 Version Scrubbed ( Moddable ) ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVUGe75nMluczrY14xb0KDXiihFRlGnV/edit)
This one is necessary because we can ( for moment) only custom WGEO file , and 4.20 have the new summoners rift with WGEO files :) 
# [Wooxy!](https://chewychronicles.wordpress.com/wooxy/)
Wooxy can be detected by antivirus windows, it's our editor of maps ! very important 
# [MOBEditor!](https://github.com/LoL-Sabre/MOBEditor)
This one is for edit position of turret, inhibitor, nexus , bush and "levelprop"
# [LoL-NGRID-converter!](https://github.com/mathiaworms/LoL-NGRID-converter/tree/editer)
-This one can export ngrid_aimesh on bmp format or write on them directly "i use a method for don't need write anything for edit them"
# [Extract RGB Pixel Color Data From Multiple Images Software](https://www.sobolsoft.com/extractrgbpixel/)
This extract from bmp file , file txt with position of pixel and their color ( free version need "delete line from txt")
